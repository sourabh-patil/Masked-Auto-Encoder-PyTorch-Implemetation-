# Masked-Auto-Encoder-PyTorch-Implemetation

This is easy to understand PyTorch Implementation of Masekd Auto Encoder. Link to the paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.06377.pdf

I have borrowed the model architecture from Facebook Research official implementation github repository. I wanted to see how this model performs with lightweight model and relatively smaller dataset. The model is trained on Stanford Cars dataset which is free to download. I have added all the python scripts from dataloader, uitls to main training script and inference script.
