# Masked-Auto-Encoder-PyTorch-Implemetation

This is easy to understand PyTorch Implementation of Masekd Auto Encoder. I have borrowed the model architecture from Facebook Research official implementation github repository. I wanted to see how this model performs with lightweight architecure and relatively smaller dataset. The model is trained on Stanford Cars dataset which is free to download. I have added all the python scripts from dataloader, uitls to main training script and inference script.
